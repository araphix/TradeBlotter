Things to do:

	1. Implement the user-login window
		1.1 Use hashCodes to verify the trader
		1.2 If an entilted user -> create a user() object for the user. Based on the user() object's 
		    parameter, using JPQL query only display the tradeinfo in the blotter for the trader's department.
		1.3 Implement a logout method which deletes the user() object and presents the login screen.
	2. In the trade blotter, on the C# side, provide "Subscription"(filtering) services.
		2.1 C# client receives the whole JSON and based on the filtering, display the selected rows.
	3. Messaging interface
		3.1 Need to discuss
